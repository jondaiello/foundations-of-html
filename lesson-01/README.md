# Lesson 01: Introduction
Hello, and welcome to Bytes & Bolts video course: Fundamentals of HTML. I’m your host, Jon Daiello (pronounced die-yellow).

In this 10 part series where we will explore what HTML is and how we can use it to build the web. This is a fundamentals course, which means it will cover the very basics of HTML, and ensure you have a firm grasp on how to use it.

## Who is this course for?
- Well this course is for:
- Anyone who wants to learn HTML
- People who know a little bit, but want to have a better foundation of what HTML actually is, and what it can do.

## Project Files
Every project has freely accessible project files associated with it. They are all stored on the [Foundations of HTML](https://github.com/jondaiello/foundations-of-html) Github repository, and freely accessible.

## So, what is HTML?
Well, let’s start at the very basis. Because, if we don’t want any assumptions to be made. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, which means it’s a language of text that your web browser uses to show you content on the web.

Whenever you browse the internet by going to a website, you do it through a web browser. A web browser is a program like Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Opera or Internet Explorer. Now, whenever you view a web page, the browser is reading HTML and then turning that HTML into what you see. Every website you visit is made up of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a myriad of other languages. However, without HTML these sites would be nothing and that’s what we’ll be focusing on. Watching that funny cat video, listening to the latest dubstep remix and reading your favorite forum thread wouldn’t be possible without HTML. It’s literally the backbone of the internet and in this course you’re going to learn how to read, write and understand HTML. 

## HTML History
HTML was created back in 1991 by Tim-Berners Lee who was a physicist at CERN. He created HTML with the hopes of connecting computers so that people around the world could access data no matter what computer they were on. Today, we’re reaping the benefits of his vision and forethought. Thanks Tim!

HTML has seen many revisions over it’s life, and today the industry standard is version 5, which is typically referred to as HTML 5. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the author of a specification that everyone from web browser makers to web developers follow as a guide on how to build for the web. You can always [explore the specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/), but it’s a bit overwhelming. That’s exactly why we’ve put together this fundamentals course for you. 

I hope you enjoy it!

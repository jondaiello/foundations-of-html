# 02: Hello There

## Software You’ll Need
To get started, we’ll need two pieces of software to work on our project:

First, we’ll need a text editor. And that’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s a simple program that allows you to write, edit and update text. Personally, I recommend Atom.io. It’s free, and that’s what we’ll be using in this course to edit our text. Plus, there are a ton of really helpful addons that you can install to help you out and improve the development process. You can also use a program like Notepad, TextEdit, or other basic text editing program, but be sure you’re saving your files in raw text, not Rich Text Editing.

Next you’ll need a web browser. 

Most operating systems come with a web browser pre-installed like [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/download-ie), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge) or [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/). There are some other great alternatives out there like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and [Opera](http://www.opera.com/). You can take your pick, and use whatever you’d like.

For this course we’ll be using Chrome to view our projects.

## Let’s Jump In!
Before we get started learning the nitty-gritty of ‘how’ and ‘why’ we do HTML, I wanted to start off with some inspiration for you. Everyone loves to accomplish something and it serves to keep the momentum going. So this lesson will focus on doing HTML.

We’re going to dive right in and build our very first HTML web page.

### Project Workspace
First, let’s create a project folder where we will store our project files. In my case, I’m going to place it on my desktop and name it `fundamentals-of-html`.

Next, I'll create a new file in that folder and name it `index.html`.

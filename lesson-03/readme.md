# Lesson 03: HTML Tags

HTML is a 'tag' based language. If we look at our example, you'll see two main types of HTML tags:

1. Normal Elements (that includes opening and closing tag)
2. Void Elements (or self-closing tags)

These are the two most common versions of tags that you'll see in your HTML adventures. Let's take an in-depth look at the tags that we've been using in our example.

## Normal Elements

As we mentioned above, normal elements have two parts: an opening tag, and a closing tag. Take a look at the headline tag we used in our example:

```html
<h1>Hello There!</h1>
```

In reality there are three parts to our element:

1. Opening Tag: `<h1>`
2. Content we want to display: `Hello There!`
3. Closing Tag: `</h1>`

## Basic HTML Tags

The first character of an HTML tag is the less than sign `<` and the last character is a greater than sign `>`.

Immediately following the `<` character is the name of the tag. In this case, it's `h1`.

After the name of the tag we end the tag with the `>` symbol.
